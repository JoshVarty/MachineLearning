The following code is to help you play with the concept of Dataframe in Pandas.

You can think of a Dataframe as something with rows and columns. It is
similar to a spreadsheet, a database table, or R's data.frame object.

*This playground is inspired by Greg Reda's post on Intro to Pandas Data Structures:

To create a dataframe, you can pass a dictionary of lists to the Dataframe
constructor:
1) The key of the dictionary will be the column name
2) The associating list will be the values within that column.

    data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
            'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions',
                     'Lions', 'Lions'],
            'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
            'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}
    football = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print football

Pandas also has various functions that will help you understand some basic
information about your data frame. Some of these functions are:
1) dtypes: to get the datatype for each column
2) describe: useful for seeing basic statistics of the dataframe's numerical
   columns
3) head: displays the first five rows of the dataset
4) tail: displays the last five rows of the dataset

# Change False to True to see these functions in action
if False:
    data = {'year': [2010, 2011, 2012, 2011, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012],
            'team': ['Bears', 'Bears', 'Bears', 'Packers', 'Packers', 'Lions',
                     'Lions', 'Lions'],
            'wins': [11, 8, 10, 15, 11, 6, 10, 4],
            'losses': [5, 8, 6, 1, 5, 10, 6, 12]}
