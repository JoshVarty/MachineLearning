# ----------
#
# In this exercise, you will create a network of perceptrons that can represent
# the XOR function, using a network structure like those shown in the previous
# quizzes.
#
# You will need to do two things:
# First, create a network of perceptrons with the correct weights
# Second, define a procedure EvalNetwork() which takes in a list of inputs and
# outputs the value of this network.
#
